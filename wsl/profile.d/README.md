# profile.d

A directory of shell scripts that `/etc/profile -> ../global.profile` calls.
Things in here run in login shells

bad-colors sets environment variables for colors that are used in my shell scripts.
It's bad because the colors don't exactly match the variable names since my
terminal is colorblind or something.
