# ambient (environment)

I "like" Windows since it has a "nice" interface and I'm used to it.
Also, some of the applications that I use are all built for Windows.
I find Windows challenging to program on since many applications meant for Linux.
Then, Microsoft made the wonderful WSL.
The files in the [Linux](linux) folder are all my precious dotfiles configured just the way I like them.
They're bold, gold, and ~~old~~ new.
Most people would call these dotfiles cursed. To me, they're some of my most prized files.
They're the result of three years of learning. Gaze upon their beauty!
