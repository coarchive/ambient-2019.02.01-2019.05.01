# ambient/linux/common

I did not write the things within this directory!

Meant for large programs like compilers which typically have lots of accompanying files.
Other programs that I didn't write or modify are in here too.

[ambient/linux/spawn/paths.sh](../../spawn/paths.sh) adds this directory to the `$PATH`
